# Password-Generator

## Description

I completed the JavaScript coding for a password generator in order to better understand the use of and connection between variables, arrays, and conditions to create a functional application that is user-friendly and accessible. I was able to do this by defining the variables and using loops and if statements. It provides clients with a simple application to reach their desired result: A random password!

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

This page will assist in generating a random password using client input for password length, letter casing, numerals, and special characters.
